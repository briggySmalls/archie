# Overview

So why does archie exist? Here are some motivators:

- **A picture's worth a thousand words**: diagrams are good for conveying system design.
- **Hand-drawing diagrams is distracting**: who wants to reposition boxes and lines?
- **Don't try to say too much**: a complex system is, well, complex. So it's better to have multiple diagrams (or views) of the same system.
- **Consistency problem**: changes, like renaming a component, shouldn't require manual updates in loads of diagrams


## The CAD analogy

Mechanical engineers have Computer Aided Design (CAD) in their toolkit.

Physical parts are designed in a modelling software, and technical drawings can be produced for different parts.
Updating the diameter of a hole? No problem, the new technical drawings will reflect that, wherever it appears.

Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) is the systems equivalent!

## Walkthrough

Lets say we're designing a snazzy new home audio system.
We might start off by picturing it in the home, and the systems it might talk to:

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: props.data.landscape.value }} />

Happy in the knowledge that we know what our system will talk to, we open it up and define the innards:

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: props.data.soundSystem.value }} />

Now what's going on in that amplifier?

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: props.data.amplifier.value }} />

Notice how there is no connection between 'speaker' and 'user'?
The amplifier doesn't care about that, it just cares about its inputs and outputs,
so that is removed from the diagram. Don't try to say too much!
