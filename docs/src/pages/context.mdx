# Context diagram

## Description

A context diagram shows the context of the specified element, with respect to a particular `scope` element.

The view contains:

1. Main elements of interest
1. Relevant associated elements.

### Main elements of interest

The main elements of interest are those that are children of the scoping element.
Or, if the scoping element has no children, the scoping element itself.

### Relevant associated elements

A relevant associated element is one that is associated to one of the main elements of interest,
where either:

- Its immediate parent is an ancestor of the scope
- It is a root element.

## Example: entire system

The simplest 'context' is one with the scope of the entire system.
All the 'top level' elements have been added (children of the world scope!).

<Example
    code="archie context model.yml"
    image={props.data.landscape.value}
    model={props.data.model.value} />

## Example: sub-item

If we change the scope to a sub-item, in this case `sound-system`, we see that it is opened up
and it's two children, `amplifier` and `speaker` are revealed.

The only connections that are shown are those that connect directly to these children.

<Example
    code="archie context model.yml --scope sound-system"
    image={props.data.soundSystem.value}
    model={props.data.model.value} />

</Layout>
