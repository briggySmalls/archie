Archie is a lightweight tool for generating model-based architecture diagrams.

Define a model...

```yaml
config:
    writer: graphviz
model:
    elements:
      - name: a
      - name: b
    associations:
      - source: a
        destination: b
```

Generate diagrams...

```archie landscape
config:
    writer: graphviz
model:
    elements:
      - name: a
      - name: b
    associations:
      - source: a
        destination: b
```
