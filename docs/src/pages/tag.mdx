# Tag diagram

## Description

The tag diagram is designed to 'burrow down' into components to reveal elements with specific tags.
Our usage usually use tags to represent different 'disciplines' in a system, e.g. software, mechanical,
electronics. We find this helpful for getting a low-level view of a system relevant for small teams.

## Definition

A tag diagram shows the context of the specified element, with respect to a particular `scope`
element.

The view contains:

1. Main elements of interest
1. Relevant associated elements.

### Main elements of interest

The main elements of interest are the 'oldest' descendents of the scoping element that have the
specified tag. Or, if the scoping element has no children, the scoping element itself.

### Relevant associated elements

A relevant associated element is one that is associated to one of the main elements of interest,
where either:

- Its got any tag and hasn't got a tagged ancestor
- It has no children, and hasn't got a tagged ancestor

## Example: entire system

The simplest 'context' is one with the scope of the entire system.
All the 'top level' elements have been added (children of the world scope!).

<Example
    code="archie tag model.yml --tag sound-system"
    image={props.data.soundSystem.value}
    model={props.data.model.value} />

## Example: sub-item

If we change the scope to a sub-item, in this case `sound-system`, we see that it is opened up
and it's two children, `amplifier` and `speaker` are revealed.

The only connections that are shown are those that connect directly to these children.

<Example
    code="archie tag model.yml --scope sound-system/amplifier"
    image={props.data.amplifier.value}
    model={props.data.model.value} />
