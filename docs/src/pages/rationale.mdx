# Rationale

So why does archie exist? Here are some motivators:

- **A picture's worth a thousand words**: diagrams are good for conveying system design.
- **Hand-drawing diagrams is distracting**: who wants to reposition boxes and lines?
- **Don't try to say too much**: a complex system is, well, complex. So it's better to have multiple diagrams (or views) of the same system.
- **Consistency problem**: changes, like renaming a component, shouldn't require manual updates in loads of diagrams


## The CAD analogy

Mechanical engineers have Computer Aided Design (CAD) in their toolkit.

Physical parts are designed in a modelling software, and technical drawings can be produced for different parts.
Updating the diameter of a hole? No problem, the new technical drawings will reflect that, wherever it appears.

Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) is the systems equivalent!
